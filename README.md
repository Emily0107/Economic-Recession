## Overview
Economic recessions cause significant disruptions to employment, housing, and income, yet they are often recognized only after major damage has occurred. This project proposes an analysis of U.S. economic data from **1960–2024** to identify patterns and early warning signals associated with recessions.

Using official data from **Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)** and recession dates from the **National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)**, we plan to examine how key economic indicators behave before, during, and after recessions.

## Proposed Data Sources
- **Unemployment Rate** (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics – FRED)
- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis – FRED)
- **Inflation Rate** (World Bank – FRED)
- **Housing Price Index** (U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency - FRED)

## Research Goals
- Identify economic indicators that act as leading signals of recessions  
- Analyze how early recession risk can be detected using historical data  
- Estimate the probability of near future recessions (e.g., 2026)  
- Compare indicator behavior across different historical recession

**This repository currently contains a project proposal.**  
Analysis, modeling, visualizations, and other findings will be added as the project is refined and developed.
